## Setup to Test Three.JS and Blender 3D animations

### This is from the course Wawa Sensei - React Three Fiber

I am learning how to use React Three Fiber and 3D Web Development

There is so much you can build with React Three Fiber

What is Three.js and what technologies are involved
Three.js, a JavaScript library, greatly expands the capabilities of website graphics by expanding 2D graphic capabilities, including 3D graphics, and in-browser games. 

This might remind you of the now-depreciated and disgraced Adobe Flash software. The Flash team developed Three.js and since then it has become open source, more secure, and more mobile responsive - it is more like a distance cousin; than a direct decedent. It also uses an interactive technology that web browsers already have, WebGL, instead of requiring a plugin like Flash.
