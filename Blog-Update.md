 What is Three.js and what technologies are involved  
Three.js, a JavaScript library, greatly expands the capabilities of website graphics by expanding 2D graphic capabilities, including 3D graphics, and in-browser games.

This might remind you of the now-depreciated and disgraced Adobe Flash software. The Flash team developed Three.js and since then it has become open source, more secure, and more mobile responsive - it is more like a distance cousin; than a direct decedent. It also uses an interactive technology that web browsers already have, WebGL and JavaScript, instead of requiring a plugin like Flash.

# 3D Web and Three.JS is not a conceptâ€¦ The web is already using

3D Web has been around since the birth of the internet. In the 90s, many movie sites used Adobe Flash (then owned by Shockwave) to display animations for movies. Apple currently uses Three.js to display content on its website.

Proof video

3D Web is not an experimental concept as one may believe  
Three.JS is already available to use and is featured on a growing number of websites
